# Data Dunkers: Labyrinth

This collection of Jupyter notebooks called "labyrinths" are notebooks covering various basketball topics requiring the user to input the correct answer to progress deeper within the notebook. Each question is subsequently built upon the previous one, with the questions at the end of the labyrinth being harder than the ones presented at the beginning.
